To run the **House-Harmonic-Filler** you need a recent a pd-vanilla distribution (http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html) with the following externals:

*bassemu~ cyclone hcs iemlib jasch_lib maxlib mrpeach pdmus vabs zexy*

We suggest you to download the dependencies via the deken plugin (https://github.com/pure-data/deken). External objects are always referenced as such in the patch, so you don't need to declare anything in advance.
