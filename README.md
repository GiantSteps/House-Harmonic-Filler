House Harmonic Filler
We are going to describe a temptative model for chord variation that could be used in contexts of live electronic music performance. Despite harmony not being a prominent aspect of many electronic popular music genres, it is still prevalent in those evolving directly from the song tradition, such as electro-pop and disco variants. Furthermore, certain sub-styles of house, especially so-called deep house, make use of chord loops borrowed from what we could call a black-american tradition, such as soul, rhythm-and-blues or even jazz, using extended chords other than simple triads (especially major and minor 7ths and 9ths, but also 13ths, suspensions and alterations). Deep house tracks often favour instrumental timbres (as opposed to synthesized ones), such as pianos, vibraphones as well as an extensive use of vocals.
We refer to the prototype we are describing as the House Harmonic Filler, inspired by the nomenclature by Moore (2012, pp. 20 ff.). According to Moore, popular music styles can be differentiated and characterized by observing four basic textural functional layers, namely the explicit beat layer, the functional bass layer, the melodic layer and the harmonic filler layer. Other theoretical concerns aside, this differentiation seems appropriate to the GiantSteps project, since it sets (or reflects) a division (but also a means of integration) of the specialized tools that we are currently researching and developing. For example, other sections of this deliverable verse about stylistic rhythmic generation and previous deliverables have dealt with generation of bass melodic lines for house music (D4.1, D4.2).
Chord Shuttles
House harmonic loops normally consist of sequences of 2 or 4 bars, with a tendency to have a single chord per bar. 8-bar loops are less frequent, and in most cases, they result from a repetition of a 4-bar pattern with some small variation toward the end of the second half.
Currently, the House Harmonic Filler is limited to operating with 2-bar loops or shuttles. According to Tagg (2014), a chord shuttle consists in an ongoing oscillation between two chords, normally of equal duration and importance. This particular behaviour is present in many of the chord loops we have analysed, each one lasting for a bar, and normally avoiding quintal jumps between their roots. Intervals of second, fourth and third (from most to less frequent) seem to be the most common jumps, favouring subdominant relations between the chords. These tonal relations tend to be ambivalent, and most of the times it is not possible to determine which chord has a tonic feel, effect which is potentiated by the endless looping mechanism. This is the reason why we have tried to avoid the tonal-functional connotations implied by classic tonal harmony (cfr. Piston, 1941), and where possible, we have interpreted the sequences as ambiguously as possible, considering both chords of the shuttle as potential tonics (I).
We will reserve the term chord loop for cyclical sequences of more than two chords, normally four (Tagg, 2014), which are excluded from this study, and will be considered in due time. The reasons for this decision are two: on a practical side, (1) dealing with a fixed length facilitates implementation while providing valid means to evaluating the integration of corpus analysis and music-theoretical knowledge. Furthermore, (2) these simple sequences, normally consisting of an alternation of just two chords, have a strong presence in other popular music styles (especially blues and its derivatives) and offer a restricted scenario in which is feasible to create music-theoretical hypotheses.
Statistical Analysis and Music Theory
For the current study, we have used limited resources publicly available on the internet. We have selected homophonic MIDI chord loops under tags of deep house piano, classic house piano and deep house chords. We realize that the collection we have used is an extreme simplification. However, since the current deliverable is a software component, we think the materials used are sufficient to prove the visualization and interaction aspects that we are presenting. Furthermore, the limitation in the corpus available has made us take a combined perspective, where corpus analysis is complemented with a theoretically-driven approach (especially for the implementation of chord substitutions and extensions). We are aware that as the analytical corpus grows, we will need to rely less on decisions based on theoretical observation. However, a proper music-theoretical study of tonality in electronic popular music is yet to be attained, and to a certain extent, the development of this prototype serves as a methodological tool to this end.
There is some previous work studying the relation of specific chord progressions and different musical genres. Moore (1992) explores a number of harmonic patterns and attempts to identify specific styles (pop, rock and soul) based on these. We consider this an interesting approach at differentiating specific electronic popular music sub-genres, and identifying certain chord progressions (and chord types) as characteristic of certain styles. We are aware that this study is at an immature stage, for we are studying only chord shuttles. However, we think this is a promising path to develop predictive/generative models for style-specific music generation and we expect to see better results when integrating longer harmonic sequences.
In any case, we are ready to present some preliminary findings from the observation of the above-mentioned chord-shuttle structures. Two-chord sequences can be obtained with a minimum of four different notes (for example, using two triads at a distance of a diatonic ascending or descending third). This makes these chord progressions tonally ambiguous, what allows for interchangeability of the sequences with different melodies or bass lines. We see this ecological strategy as a stylistic feature, since the current genres are highly based on compositional techniques proceeding by layering of different pre-cooked materials. This is suggesting us a new theoretical concept, that of keyness, by which we would be able to measure the univocity of a harmonic or melodic loop. (A similar concept, in relation to European Classical Music, was proposed by Temperley (2007).)
Figure 21 shows a bar chart with percentages of different degrees of modal ambiguity. Note that this measure is based on the number of notes present on each loop, i.e., the possibility of different modes (or intervallic patterns) for the same tonic, rather than having multiple tonics, since we have already mentioned that these loops are inherently ambivalent in this regard. Column 1 represents the percentage of loops that contain pitch-class sets of 7 notes, which we are considering as modally unambiguous; the 2nd column represents loops that contain 6-or-less different pitch classes, and that could be read on two to three different modes simultaneously (modally ambiguous); and finally, the rightmost column represents shuttles that contain 8-or-more notes, implying a degree of chromatism that can be explained using modern- or jazz-music theory and that we are temptatively considering as chromatically extended).

Figure 21. Distribution of chord shuttles by number of different pitch classes.

While the distribution of major and minor chords is evenly distributed, 60% of the chords in the corpus have more than 4 notes (7ths, 9ths and other additions), versus the 40% of regular triads.
Regarding modality per se, the corpus presents a predominance of the minor modes, aeolian, dorian and phrygian (in descending order) followed by the mixolydian, ionian, and the lydian major variants.
Software Description and Interaction
Our application promotes the source-variation model introduced in section ???XXX. It takes a single MIDI chord loop, which serves as the reference musical material on which variations are performed in real-time. As already discussed, loops are limited to two bars in length, although this will be expanded to lengthier excerpts in the near future. The loop is analyzed in terms of rhythm, duration, chord progression and scale, in order to extract different layers of information and manipulation.
Rhythmic Variation: Style Agnostic Density Transformer
As explained above, harmony is a complex musical category that can not be considered in isolation from other musical parameters. In relation to rhythm, harmony progresses in time displaying a certain harmonic rhythm, which is the pace at which chord-changes structure time. This tends to be regular, especially in the styles we are studying, with chords changing at every bar. However the harmonic loops we are presenting have a clear motivic identity (call this hook, vamp or riff, the underlying concept is that of a harmonic-rhythmic-melodic compound recognizable as a unit and characteristic of a piece of music).
This surface rhythmic layer is processed according to the Agnostic Density Transformer described in D4.1, section 2.1:
“It is based on the fact that syncopated onsets, as challenges to regularity, are the most definitive elements of a rhythmic pattern, as opposed to onsets that reinforce the beat’s regularity, which we consider to be least important on the definition of a rhythmic pattern.” (excerpted from D4.1, section 2.1)
This strategy for rhythmic variation maintains the original's rhythmic feel, while adding or subtracting elements in real-time. Therefore, the user can make the pattern more dense or sparse, while always being able to return to the original rhythmic pattern. We have expanded the rhythmic hierarchy from a single bar to operate on larger time units (sequences of 2, 4 or 8 bars).
Duration
The Density Agnostic Transformer only takes information (and possibility of variation) about the onsets (i.e. the position of the attacks). Whether this might be sufficient to model percussive instruments, where the location of a hit might be enough to replicate a pattern, manipulation of sounds that can be prolongated on time (as most pitched-instruments do, to different extents and by different techniques), need to take care of the duration of the sounds. In the current prototype, we have treated duration as a separate layer of the onset positions (density). We have analysed the duration of each note according to its position on the metrical grid, and assigned zeroth order probabilities to each step position. The overall duration of the pattern can be adjusted by a so-called legato control, which is the result of combining the onsets layer (density) with the zeroth order probability of the durations per step, resulting in a continuum going from legato (all notes ending at the moment of a new attack) to an imperfect stacatto (all notes having the duration of the minimum step size, a 16th note in the current implementation).
Harmonic Variation
We have opted for a theoretical model (rather than a Markov model) as a means to introduce harmonic variation for the following reasons: On the one hand, (1) the House Harmonic Filler takes one chord progression as a reference pattern, over which it performs variations, from similar to extremely dissimilar. The corpus we have used (40 loops) is far too small to provide us with a meaningful range of variations, which we have supplied by theoretical derivation. On the other hand, (2) two-step progressions are too short to allow for non-redundant Markovian processes, since a two-element 1st order Markov chain would already represent the whole harmonic sequence. (3) Furthermore, a step/bar-based probability (zeroth order Markov sequence) proves meaningless, since there is not a clear sense of a tonic, nor that of beginning or end, given the circularity of the loop.
Therefore, the chord structure proper can be modified following two different and complementary strategies:
By changing the so-called color or tension of each chord, that is, by modifying the number of notes in the chord while keeping the same function and root. This is a technique characteristic of jazz-derived styles, present in deep house music, by which one can pile up thirds (to make chords of 7th, 9th, 11th and 13th) or added notes (6th, 9th, 4th). The chord saturation control, offers a range of variation from the so-called power-chord at one extreme (the highest reduction of a chord, by which even the major/minor typology is omitted) to chromatic additions on the other end (adding notes that do not belong to the current scale). However, most of the interactive range of the color control, deals with addition of tensions according to the detected scale or possible derivatives, when a defective pitch-class set is present (i.e. groups of notes consisting of six or less notes).
The other approach is borrowed from both classic and modern music theory, and is based on the assumption that certain chords can temporarily substitute other chords, maintaining the original tonal function. There is extensive literature on rules of chord substitution; we refer the reader to two works already mentioned in this report for brief and extensive surveys on this issue (Moore, 1992; Piston, 1941). 
The substitution distance control proceeds from very tonal substitutions at one extreme to chromatic substitution on the other, although this might not be idiomatic of the styles in consideration.
Register Expansion
A register expansion control allows variations in the vertical layout of the chord, from closed position (all notes of the chord contained within the same octave) to higher and lower expansion to up to 4 octaves. Additionally, we provide a binary checkbox to allow chord inversions, which will let the lowest note of the chord aggregate be different from the lowest note in the original. We remind the reader that the intended use of the House Harmonic Filler is that of filling the mid-register harmonic layer, and that it normally should be used in conjunction with an existing or generated bass line. Being this the case, the actual lowest note of the chord might not necessarily be that of the chord generated with the current tool.
Overall Activity Control
Last, we offer an Overall Activity control which simultaneously influences the amount of variation of the tonal parameters just described, resulting in a sort of voice leading control according to the color, substitution and register parameters, from a single change per chord on one extreme, to changes in the vertical configuration of the chord at every new onset.
Again, the activity control follows a model based on the theory behind the agnostic density transformer (Lerdahl and Jakendoff, 1983) by which less rhythmically-significant steps are modified first.
Visualization
The House Harmonic Filler is presented as a two-window GUI. The real-time interaction is limited to a very simple interface with a series of sliders controlling the parameters just described (Figure 22).

A second window (Figure 23) provides visualization information about the live transformations on the MIDI Loop. This window presents a two-bar length grid quantized at 16th notes, with a three-layer box system on top. The layer at the background represents a metronome progressing along the sequence beats in sync with the tempo set by the user. The middle-ground layer represents the original pattern: each box represents a chord event, labeled with its chord name, where start- and end-points, as well as duration are represented by the rectangles position and horizontal length. Similarly, the forefront layer displays the modifications on real-time requested by the user. In the screenshot shown in Figure 23, density is set to 8 and legato to 0 (all 16th notes).

Installation
The current prototype is implemented in the Pd/Gem environment, and is delivered as a folder with a collection of original MIDI loops and all the files necessary for its usage.
The prototype and some Midi loops can be downloaded from the GiantSteps Github page:
https://github.com/GiantSteps/House-Harmonic-Filler
The user needs to meet some dependencies, in principle available on all major OS’s:
Pd-extended (>=0.43.4) with Gem image extension.
Python (>= 2.7)
Tcl/Tk (>= 8.5). This is also needed for Pd itself, so if Pd runs normally, it means that this dependency is already installed.
We provide a bash script that opens Pd in the background, launching a two-window user interface.
Future Development
We are already expanding the current framework to operate with larger excerpts of music. This demands new theoretical formalizations that we are gaining through manual and computational analysis. Furthermore, as the corpus of styles grows, we will be able to contrast our theoretical findings with statistical truth, and rely less and less in pre-cooked musical knowledge that may seem arbitrary at some points (i.e. chord substitutions).
In terms of functionality, we are implementing MIDI-learn and master/slave synchronization with external MIDI clocks. We are also working at packaging the prototype as a vst-plugin, to facilitate integration with professional audio software, especially aimed at the demos that will be carried on with expert users (i.e. Red Bull Music Academy & STEIM).
