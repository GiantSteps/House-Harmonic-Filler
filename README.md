This is a pd-vanilla version of the House-Harmonic-Filler that makes use of the following externals and/or libraries:

*arraysize cyclone ggee hcs iemlib jasch_lib list-abs maxlib mrpeach pddp unauthorized zexy*

We suggest you to use a recent pd-vanilla distribution and download/install the dependencies via the deken plugin (https://github.com/pure-data/deken). External objects are always referenced as such in the abstractions, so you don't need to declare anything in advance.

Furthermore you need the pdmus library (not-yet available via deken): https://github.com/angelfaraldo/pdmus.
