To run the **House-Harmonic-Filler** you need a recent a pd-vanilla (http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html) distribution with the following externals:

*arraysize cyclone ggee hcs iemlib jasch_lib list-abs maxlib mrpeach pddp flatgui zexy*

We suggest you to download the dependencies via the deken plugin (https://github.com/pure-data/deken). External objects are always referenced as such in the patch, so you don't need to declare anything in advance.

Furthermore you need the pdmus library (not-yet available via deken): https://github.com/angelfaraldo/pdmus.
