To run the **House-Harmonic-Filler** you need the latests stable pd-vanilla distribution (0.46.7). You can download it from Miller Puckette's website (http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html), of from the Pd main site (puredata.info). Beware that Pd-extended is now obsolete. For ease of use, we have included all the external files needed with this download, so downloading this patch is all you need to do to start using the program.
