(general purpose pd-vanilla abstractions)

This collection of abstractions is a branch of pdmus, a series of pd objects for symbolic manipulation of music (https://github.com/angelfaraldo/pdmus). I provide these separately because I think they can be useful in general purpose scenarios.

All the abstractions are vanilla compliant (>=0.46). As such, some of them implement in vanilla objects that are otherwise found in other collections (especially zexy). Other objects introduce new functions that I have not met in native or external objects.
